# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
A discount is only applied if it is **20% or higher**; otherwise, the original price is returned.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter:
  - The original price of the item
  - The discount percentage
- If the discount is **20% or more**, the discount is applied.
- If the discount is **less than 20%**, no discount is applied and the original price is displayed.

## Example
```
Enter the original price of the item: 1000  
Enter the discount percentage: 25  
Discount applied! The final price is: 750.00  
```

## Running the Script
Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python discount_calculator.py
```
